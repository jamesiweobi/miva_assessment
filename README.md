This project contains two Go exercises:
- `task_one/task_one.go` processes a seeded log file concurrently to tally keyword occurrences with basic panic handling.
- `task_two/task_two.go` interactively sums the first *N* prime palindromic numbers using a generator goroutine and safe input validation.
